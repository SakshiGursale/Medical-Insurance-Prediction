# Medical-Insurance-Prediction

### Project Description:

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the medical insurance claims for a given population. The model will be developed using historical data on medical insurance claims, demographic information, and medical records. The aim of this project is to help insurance companies to better estimate the costs of providing medical insurance coverage and to identify high-risk patients who require more intensive medical care.

### The project will involve the following steps:

### 1. Data Collection: 
Collecting a large dataset of medical insurance claims from various sources such as hospitals, insurance companies, and government agencies. The dataset should include information on patient demographics, medical history, diagnosis, treatment, and cost.

### 2.Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning and preprocessing the data by removing any missing values, duplicates, or irrelevant information.

### 3.Feature Engineering: 
Extracting relevant features from the dataset that can help in predicting medical insurance claims. Some of the features that can be considered include age, gender, medical history, diagnosis, treatment, and cost.

### 4.Model Selection: 
Selecting an appropriate machine learning model for predicting medical insurance claims. Some of the commonly used models include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

### 5.Model Training: 
Training the selected model on the preprocessed dataset using appropriate techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning.

### 6.Model Evaluation: 
Evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared.

### Flask And Postman :
Using flask we write a feamework in python and using postmen we predict the insurance charges using independent features
